City of Torontoâ€™s open data portal is a great initiative that provides a ton of datasets to explore and understand how the city of Toronto works. For this project particularly, I took up the Covid-19-cases, which contains demographic and geographic information of all the cases reported to Toronto public health. This data updates on a weekly basis and the current analysis contains data until February 1st, 2021.
